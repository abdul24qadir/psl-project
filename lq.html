        <center><h2>Lahore Qalandars</h2></center>
      <p>Lahore Qalandars (Urdu: لاہور قلندرز; Punjabi: لہور قلندرز; abbreviated as LQ) is a Pakistani professional cricket franchise which plays in the Pakistan Super League, representing the city of Lahore.[2] The home ground of the team is Gaddafi Stadium. The team is owned by Rana Brothers. The team is currently captained by Shaheen Afridi and coached by Aaqib Javed, a former Pakistani cricketer.[3]
<br>
        Lahore Qalandars is owned by Rana brothers. It was the second-most expensive franchise, and one of the few teams sold to an international company.[4] The team finished at the bottom spot in the points table in each of the first four seasons of the PSL, before making its first appearance in the final in the 2020 edition. Then the team made another appearance in the 2022 PSL edition and won the season.
    <br>    
        Fakhar Zaman is the leading run-scorer and Shaheen Afridi is the leading wicket-taker for the side.
          </p>
          <center><h3>Franchise history</h3></center>
        <p>In 2015, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced that the inaugural season of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) would take place in February 2016 in the United Arab Emirates. On 3 December 2015, the PCB unveiled the owners of five city-based franchises. The Lahore franchise was sold to the Kausar Rana Resources Private Limited Company for US$25.1 million for a span of ten years, making it the second-most expensive team of PSL (after the Karachi Kings, which sold for US$26 million). <br>

            In 2016, under Players Development Program (PDP), the Lahore Qalandars franchise organised "Jazz Rising Stars" trials across eight Pakistani cities, to identify upcoming youth talent. Shortlisted players would travel to Australia and train with Sydney Thunder, while the top two performers would get the opportunity to play for the Qalandars. During the programme an ambidextrous fast bowler, Yasir Jan from Rawalpindi, was identified by former Pakistan fast bowler Aqib Javed.</p>
