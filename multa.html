      <p>Multan Sultans (Urdu, Punjabi: ملتان سلطانز) is a Pakistani professional Twenty20 franchise cricket team 
        representing the city of Multan in southern Pakistan in the Pakistan Super League (PSL). The team was 
        founded in 2017 as an additional sixth team added to the PSL. The team plays its home matches at Multan
        Cricket Stadium.<br>

          After their debut season, Schön Properties who bought the team in 2017, failed to pay their annual fee,
          and their contract was terminated;[9][10] in December 2018, a consortium formed by Alamgir Khan Tareen,
            the majority shareholder, and Ali Khan Tareen became the new owners of the team. In 2021, Alamgir Khan
            Tareen took over as the sole owner.<br>
          
          The team won its first PSL title in the 2021 season.</p>
          <center><h3>
            Franchise history
          </h3></center>
        <p>In April 2017, a few weeks after the conclusion of 2017 Pakistan Super League, PSL chairman Najam Sethi
          announced that there would be a sixth team in the third season. The Pakistan Cricket Board short-listed 
          five regions as possibilities for the sixth team. In June 2017, the team was established with the 
          franchise having been was bought by Schön Properties after winning a bid for an eight-year contract against
            10 contesting bidders. <br>

          On 10 November 2018, the PCB announced that the franchise agreement had been terminated and all rights
          in respect to the franchise were returned to the board. The termination was due to the franchise failing
            to pay the annual fee required by the PCB.[9][10] The PCB took responsibility of all player and coach 
            contracts whilst a public tender process took place to sell the repackaged rights for the franchise. 
            Alamgir Khan Tareen and Ali Khan Tareen of Multan Consortium, won the bid for the team. In 2021, Alamgir Khan Tareen bought the sole ownership rights.</p>
